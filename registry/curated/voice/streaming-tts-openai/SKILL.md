# OpenAI Streaming TTS

Low-latency streaming text-to-speech using OpenAI's TTS API. Buffers incoming LLM tokens into
natural sentence chunks before making API requests, enabling audio playback to begin within
the first sentence rather than waiting for full LLM output.

## Setup

Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your environment or agent secrets store.

## Features

- Adaptive sentence chunking: emits audio after each `.`, `?`, `!`, or `;` boundary
- Fallback flush timer (default 2 000 ms) for fragments without punctuation
- Concurrent fetch pipelining: starts fetching the next sentence while the current one plays
- AbortController-based cancellation for all in-flight requests
- Supports all OpenAI TTS voices: alloy, echo, fable, onyx, nova, shimmer
- Configurable model (tts-1, tts-1-hd) and output format (opus, mp3, aac, flac, wav, pcm)

## Configuration

In `agent.config.json`:

```json
{
  "voice": {
    "tts": "openai"
  }
}
```

Provider-specific options via `providerOptions`:

```json
{
  "voice": {
    "tts": "openai",
    "providerOptions": {
      "model": "tts-1",
      "voice": "nova",
      "format": "opus",
      "maxBufferMs": 2000
    }
  }
}
```
