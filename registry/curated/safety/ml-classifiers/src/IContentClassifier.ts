/**
 * @fileoverview Interface contract for ML-backed content classifiers.
 *
 * An `IContentClassifier` represents a single model pipeline that accepts
 * arbitrary text and returns a {@link ClassificationResult} containing the
 * winning label and confidence scores for all candidate classes.
 *
 * Built-in implementations (toxicity, injection, jailbreak) each implement
 * this interface.  Third-party classifiers may be registered via the
 * `customClassifiers` option of {@link MLClassifierPackOptions}.
 *
 * Lifecycle
 * ---------
 * 1. The pack initialises each classifier (model loading, warm-up).
 * 2. The guardrail pipeline calls `classify()` for every text chunk.
 * 3. On pack teardown, `dispose()` is called (if present) to release GPU/
 *    WASM memory.
